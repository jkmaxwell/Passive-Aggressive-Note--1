How to Maintain a Supply of Cold Beverages

# Intro

At Mint.com, in the 280 Hope St. days, we had a refrigerator. In this refrigerator, we kept beverages. These beverages were cold. Like most refrigerators, the available volume dictated a ceiling on the number of simultaneously available cold beverages. Like most refrigerators, it did not stock itself. Therefore, we needed to communicate how the system worked to those interacting with the unit.

# Usage

## Main

1. Print
2. Tape to refrigerator

## Optional
- Translate to your own language and commit as instructions-language_name.whatever. Open a pull req and I'll merge it quickly.
- Edit the graffle file and add it as another layer if you know how to use OmniGraffle
- Improve the diagram, or supplement it with additional diagrams specific to your situation
